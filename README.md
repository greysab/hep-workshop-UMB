# hep-workshop-UMB


Welcome to the machine learning tutorial of the second HEP workshop at UMB, Msila!

<center>In this two days tutorial, we will cover programing basics and machine learning concepts in High Energy Physics. Machine learning is increasingly used to process and analyze the data collected from the LHC. At the end of this tutorial you will be able to grasp the basics behind machine learning and data science as well as get an insight into how and where it is used at CERN.
